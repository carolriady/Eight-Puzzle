# Eight-Puzzle
The project involves applying state-space search to a classic problem known as the Eight Puzzle, which is a 3x3 grid containing 8 numbered tiles and one empty or blank cell. 

Tiles that are adjacent to the blank cell can move into that position in the grid, and solving the puzzle involves moving the tiles until you reach the following goal state:

In this project, we applied state-space search to solve any valid initial configuration of the Eight Puzzle.

Some parts of the project will be required – including an implementation of several classic state-space algorithms – but other parts will be left to your creativity. In particular, you will see that some initial configurations of the Eight Puzzle – ones that require a large number of moves – can be difficult to solve in a reasonable amount of time, and you will be encouraged to develop variations on the required algorithms that will reduce the time needed to find a solution!
